# Contributing

Contributions are welcome but the project is currently in a pre-release phase: keep in mind that most functionality is subject to changes that may include backwards incompatibilities until an initial release version is published.

If you have any questions about contributing and want to get in touch with the maintainers, check in on [#kong in Kubernetes Slack][slack].
